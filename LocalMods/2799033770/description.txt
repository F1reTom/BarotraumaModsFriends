[h2]Current Features[/h2]
IF THE NEW CONTENT IS NOT LOADING then you haven't enabled the mod dummy ^^

[b] All genetic material is removable without destroying it, and you dont lose your genes on death (except when admin revives you, then you need to take off your genes and put then back on again. Also when you lose your duffel bag, and your items with it, you lose your genes ^^) [/b]

[h3]Items[/h3]
Adds 24 new gene splicers with far more capacity than the vanilla ones, up to 26 capacity:
Alfa requires advanced gene splicer, so your medic isn't useless, like in previous version of the mod!
Every 6 genes cost goes up, but the final effect is worth it!
List of all of them in order:
[list]
[*] Gene Splicer Alpha
[*] Gene Splicer Beta

[h3]Added Genes[/h3]
[list]
[*] (NEW!) Watcher Genes allows harness an abilities of a watcher, and provides a boost in damage resistance.
[*] Psilotoad Genes which act as antibiotics and are a natural defense against husk infections, however they only slowly reduce the infection so if you receive several injections or bite wounds from a husk, you may still become fully infected.
[*] Fractal Guardian Genes, these dormant genes stemming from the fractal guardian enhances your repair speed greatly and also provides minor damage resistance.
[*] Golden Hammerhead Genes, increases movement speed greatly on land and massively in the water, also provides minor damage resistances.
